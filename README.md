# Rust Learning
## Written by Aaron Chamberlain

This is just a bunch of code as I'm learning rust. Most of it is just experimenting with standard language functions, and some are projects to use some of the knowledge.

I hope to focus on compiling to WASM and embedded Rust and good code testing procedures.
